Chat application I built using socket.io, a library for real-time chat applications (and other real-time functionalities).

I built this as an exercise to learn setting up a server in nodejs and sending data back and forth from the client. It's not quite polished as I got side-tracked...

https://socket.io/ for documentation and information.
